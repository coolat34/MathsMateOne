# MathsMateOne
MathsMateOne is an introductory mathematics app designed to build confidence in algebra step by step.

The app begins with an Algebra Primer and provides 16 menu-driven topics, each focusing on a key aspect of algebra. Topics progress in difficulty and cover areas such as:
	•	Mathematical terminology
	•	Expressions and equations
	•	Brackets and order of operations
	•	Exponents, powers, and roots
	•	Fractions and simplification

Each topic includes clear explanations and worked examples. Most sections also provide interactive exercises, allowing users to test their understanding. Answers are revealed by simply tapping on a question, opening a pop-up card that displays the solution. Some answers include step-by-step workings to help explain how the result is obtained.

MathsMateOne is ideal for learners who want a structured, approachable introduction to algebra concepts.
